All protocols. This lab is based on a youtube video by PM Networking(if you're reading this, many thanks for your content!). The video ends at configuring the connectivity between R1 and R2 leaving it up to the students to complete. This lab takes off from there and is my attempt to complete the topology and create a roadmap to extend as a study lab for the CCNA certification. 

The following protocols were configured. 

OSPF
VTP
EGRIP
VPN
VLAN
Etherchannels (L2/L3)



Topology as follows:
