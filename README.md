# cisco-gns3-labs

Each directory is a separate networking lab. Each lab contains one or more configuration files with CLI commands to stand up the topology. 

Configuration scripts for each lab are segmented by node. Example: 

```
# node-name-1

enable
configure terminal
hostname <node-name-1>
exit

# node-name-2

```
