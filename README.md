# cisco-gns3-labs

Welcome to my GNS3 lab repository. This is my playground for any lab I run in GNS3 for Networking, Security, Automation, etc. Each directory is a separate lab. Each lab contains one or more configuration files with CLI commands to stand up the topology, A README.md file with lab instructions and topology maps. 

Configuration scripts for each lab are segmented by node. Example: 

```
# node-name-1

enable
configure terminal
hostname <node-name-1>
exit

# node-name-2

```

Most of these are work in progress with a "To-Do" Section.
